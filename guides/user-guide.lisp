(header "The ADP User Guide" user-guide-header)

(text "Welcome to the ADP User Guide! Here you will learn how to add documentation to your projects using ADP. ADP can be divided in two groups of functions. The API functions and Guide function. However, despite that distinction all the functions can be mixed to generate your documentation.")

(text "I will try to do my best explaining how to use ADP. If this is not sufficient, note that every piece of documentation of ADP has been generated by itself. So you can see the source code and see how ADP has been used. For example, this file was generated using the source located at " (code-inline "guides/user-guide.lisp") ".")


(subheader "Setting up ADP")

(text "After installing ADP, you must add it as a dependency in your project, like you have been doing for every project you want to use. For example, if you have a system like this:")

(code-block ()
  (asdf:defsystem :my-system
    (code-hide ())
    :depends-on (:uiop :alexandria)
    (code-hide ())))

(text "You only need to add " (code-inline ":adp") " to the " (code-inline "depends on") " list.")

  (asdf:defsystem :my-system
    (code-hide ())
    :depends-on (:uiop :alexandria :adp)
