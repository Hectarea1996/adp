Besides, note that the pathname does not include an extension. This is because later you can select between different styles and each style will generate different types of files. After writing this line of code we can start to use the rest of the macros.")

(subheader "Functions to generate the API")

(text "I'm sure your code defines a lot of things like functions, macros and symbols. In order to do that you have had to use define macros like " (cl-ref defun) ", " (cl-ref defmacro) " or " (cl-ref defparameter) ". Print some documentation of this definitions is very easy with ADP.

(text "That's all! Actually, note that if you load your project as always after changing some defuns, you will see that nothing happens. Your system is loaded normally and nothing changes. This is because the documentation generation is disabled by default. So, even if you add ADP code, the original code remains the same.")

(text "I hope this guide is useful. I usually see Common Lisp projects that looks awesome but they lack guides or even documentation. That's why I started to document all my projects and then I realized that I needed some tool to make it easier. I know that there are already other documentation generators, but none of them suits my needs. Luckily, Common Lisp makes doing this kind of tools relatively easy compared to other languages. Lastly, I want to give you some tips or ways to use ADP that I ended up doing myself.")

(itemize (item (emphasis "Use a different system for documentation generation") ": I recommend to use a different system to indicate all the files you need to load to generate the documentation. So, if you have a system named " (inline-code :my-system) " then create another system named " (inline-code :my-system/docs) ". Although ADP will not execute anything unless you use the function " (function-ref load-system) ", I think this should make your projects cleaner. And, let's be honest, I'm still learning the language and I don't want to break other people's code. I did this separation for ADP, so you can see an example in the file " (inline-code "adp.asd") ".")
	 (item (emphasis "Handling error messages") ": I tried to make informative error messages but sometimes this cannot be possible. Or, at least, I can't do it better. The most common errors I have had when using ADP were undefined variable errors. Remember that " (function-ref inline-code) " works the same as " (function-ref text) ". You can't write " (inline-code "(inline-code name-of-function)") ", you must write this instead " (inline-code "(inline-code \"name-of-function\")") " or " (inline-code "(inline-code 'name-of-function)") ". Also, be careful when using " (function-ref function-ref) " or similars. If you don't write correctly the macro, some implementations will treat that call as a function call and will treat the argument as a variable. That's not a variable that ADP or you have defined and it is sure that it will raise an undefined variable error.")
	 (item (emphasis "Tags belong to a package!") ": Note that tags are actually symbols, and symbols belong to a package. If you define a tag and you want to make a reference to it from another package, remember to add the package extension to the symbol name. For example, suppose that you define the symbol-tag " (inline-code 'my-tag) " in the package " (inline-code :my-pkg) ". Then, in another package you must write " (inline-code "(symbol-ref my-pkg:my-tag)") ", or " (inline-code "(symbol-ref my-pkg::my-tag)") " if the symbol is not exported. And yes, you should export the tags you want to use in other packages.")
	 (item (emphasis "Read the API") ": Maybe reading " (header-ref user-api-header) " can make you understand better how some macros work (or not). At least, you may be interested in seeing the section " (header-ref additional-functions-subheader) " or " (header-ref macro-characters-subheader) ".")
	 (item (emphasis "That's all! Enjoy using ADP.") " I leave you with " (symbol-ref a-parameter-defined-at-the-end-of-the-file) " and " (type-ref also-a-type?) " again."))
