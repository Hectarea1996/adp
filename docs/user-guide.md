# The ADP User Guide

Welcome to the ADP User Guide! Here you will learn how to add documentation to your projects using ADP. ADP can be divided in two groups of functions. The API functions and Guide function. However, despite that distinction all the functions can be mixed to generate your documentation.

I will try to do my best explaining how to use ADP. If this is not sufficient, note that every piece of documentation of ADP has been generated by itself. So you can see the source code and see how ADP has been used. For example, this file was generated using the source located at `guides/user-guide.lisp`.

## Setting up ADP

After installing ADP, you must add it as a dependency in your project, like you have been doing for every project you want to use. For example, if you have a system like this:

```
(ASDF/PARSE-DEFSYSTEM:DEFSYSTEM :MY-SYSTEM
  ...
  :DEPENDS-ON
  (:UIOP :ALEXANDRIA)
  ...)
```

You only need to add `:adp` to the `depends on` list.

```
(ASDF/PARSE-DEFSYSTEM:DEFSYSTEM :MY-SYSTEM
  ...
  :DEPENDS-ON
  (:UIOP :ALEXANDRIA :ADP)
  ...)
```

Your system is now ready to use ADP.

## Functions to generate the API

I'm sure your code defines a lot of things like functions, macros and symbols. In order to do that you have had to use define macros like [DEFUN](http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_defun.htm), [DEFMACRO](http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_defmac.htm) or [DEFPARAMETER](http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_defpar.htm). Print some documentation of this definitions is very easy with ADP. For example, consider this function definition:

```
(DEFUN FOO (A B C) "Multiply a by the sum of b and c." (* A (+ B C)))
```

If you want to generate documentation of this definition you only need to use the macro [ADP:DEFUN](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defun) instead of [DEFUN](http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_defun.htm).

```
(ADP:DEFUN FOO (A B C) "Multiply a by the sum of b and c." (* A (+ B C)))
```

That's all! Actually, note that if you load your project as always after changing some defuns, you will see that nothing happens. Your system is loaded normally and nothing changes. This is because the documentation generation is disabled by default. So, even you add ADP code your original code remains the same.

Same as with [ADP:DEFUN](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defun), every macro that defines something is redefined to print documentation. You can see every macro here: [API documentation functions](/docs/user-api.md#api-documentation-functions)

## Functions to generate guides.

The other group of functions are intended to generate guides and tutorials (like this one). But you can use them wherever you want and however you want. Even you can use them together with the API functions above.

### Headers

You can add headers in your documentation. In other words, they work as titles or subtitles. You can this way organize your guide with different sections (like I do in this guide). The macros that add headers are [ADP:HEADER](/docs/user-api.md#macro-header), [ADP:SUBHEADER](/docs/user-api.md#macro-subheader) and [ADP:SUBSUBHEADER](/docs/user-api.md#macro-subsubheader). They need a string as the first argument.

```
(ADP:HEADER "The title of my guide.")

(ADP:SUBHEADER "A section of my guide.")

(ADP:SUBSUBHEADER "A subsection of my guide.")
```

As I said, I'm using headers in this guide. This is a header: [The ADP User Guide](/docs/user-guide.md#the-adp-user-guide). This is a subheader: [Setting up ADP](/docs/user-guide.md#setting-up-adp). And this is a subsubheader: [Headers](/docs/user-guide.md#headers). Note that I can make a reference to a header. I can achieve this with header-tags. We will see this later in [Cross references](/docs/user-guide.md#cross-references).

### Text

When you want to add text you must use the macro [ADP:TEXT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-text). It receives a variable number of arguments. Each argument is evaluated at run-time and its result is [PRINC](http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_wr_pr.htm)-ed. Then, all the content that has been [PRINC](http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_wr_pr.htm)-ed is concatenated into a single string and finally it is printed in the documentation file. For example:

```
(ADP:TEXT "This is the text macro. The result of 3+4 is " (+ 3 4)
          ". As we will see later you can enrich the text with "
          (ADP:BOLD "bold words") ", " (ADP:ITALIC "italic words") ", "
          (ADP:BOLD-ITALIC "bold-italic words") " and more.")
```

If I use that right now:

This is the text macro. The result of 3+4 is 7. As we will see later you can stylize the text with **bold words**, _italic words_, or ***bold-italic words*** among other styles.

### Tables

You can add tables using the macro [ADP:TABLE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-table). The best way to see how to use it is an example. Imagine we want to show some data stored in some variables.

```
(DEFPARAMETER PETER-INFO '(34 "Peter Garcia" 1435))

(DEFPARAMETER MARIA-INFO '(27 "Maria Martinez" 1765))

(DEFPARAMETER LAURA-INFO '(53 "Laura Beneyto" 1543))

(DEFUN GET-AGE (INFO) (FIRST INFO))

(DEFUN GET-NAME (INFO) (SECOND INFO))

(DEFUN GET-SALARY (INFO) (THIRD INFO))
```

Now we can create a table like this:

```
(ADP:TABLE ((:CELL "Age") (:CELL "Name") (:CELL "Salary"))
           ((:CELL (GET-AGE PETER-INFO)) (:CELL (GET-NAME PETER-INFO))
            (:CELL (GET-SALARY PETER-INFO) "€"))
           ((:CELL (GET-AGE MARIA-INFO)) (:CELL (GET-NAME MARIA-INFO))
            (:CELL (GET-SALARY MARIA-INFO) "€"))
           ((:CELL (GET-AGE LAURA-INFO)) (:CELL (GET-NAME LAURA-INFO))
            (:CELL (GET-SALARY LAURA-INFO) "€")))
```

And you will see this:

| Age | Name | Salary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 34 | Peter Garcia | 1435€ |
| 27 | Maria Martinez | 1765€ |
| 53 | Laura Beneyto | 1543€ |


Note that in the _Salary_ column we used multiple values in each cell. Each cell can accept multiple values and they are treated as if they are in the [ADP:TEXT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-text) macro. In other words, each element in a cell is [PRINC](http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_wr_pr.htm)-ed and the results are concatenated.

### Lists

You can add lists with [ADP:ITEMIZE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-itemize). For example:

```
(ADP:ITEMIZE (:ITEM "Vegetables:")
             (:ITEMIZE (:ITEM 3 " peppers:")
              (:ITEMIZE (:ITEM 1 " green pepper")
               (:ITEM (- 3 1) " red pepper"))
              (:ITEM 0.25 "Kg of carrots"))
             (:ITEM "Fruits:")
             (:ITEMIZE (:ITEM 0.5 "Kg of apples") (:ITEM 6 " oranges")))
```

You will see this:

* Vegetables:
  * 3 peppers:
    * 1 green pepper
    * 2 red pepper
  * 0.25Kg of carrots
* Fruits:
  * 0.5Kg of apples
  * 6 oranges

Note that each item inside [ADP:ITEMIZE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-itemize) is a list starting with `ITEM` or `ITEMIZE`. When you use `ITEM` every object will be [PRINC](http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_wr_pr.htm)-ed and then concatenated. In other words, it works the same as [ADP:TEXT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-text) or [ADP:TABLE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-table). On the other hand, when using `ITEMIZE` you are indicating that you want a sublist of items.

### Text enrichment

Inside a [ADP:TEXT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-text) form, a `CELL` from a [ADP:TABLE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-table) form and a `ITEM` form a [ADP:ITEMIZE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-itemize) form, we can enrich the text with the macros [ADP:BOLD](/docs/user-api.md#macro-bold), [ADP:ITALIC](/docs/user-api.md#macro-italic), [ADP:BOLD-ITALIC](/docs/user-api.md#macro-bold-italic) and [ADP:WEB-LINK](/docs/user-api.md#macro-web-link). For example:

```
(ADP:TEXT "As " (ADP:BOLD "Andrew") " said: "
          (ADP:ITALIC "You only need " (+ 1 2 3)) " "
          (ADP:WEB-LINK "coins" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin") " "
          (ADP:ITALIC "to enter in") " "
          (ADP:BOLD-ITALIC "The Giant Red Tree."))
```

You will see this:

As **Andrew** said: _You only need 6_ [coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin) _to enter in_ ***The Giant Red Tree.***

Note that spaces are placed out of enrichment functions (after `italic` and `web-link` calls). Also, you cannot nest calls of [ADP:BOLD](/docs/user-api.md#macro-bold), [ADP:ITALIC](/docs/user-api.md#macro-italic), [ADP:BOLD-ITALIC](/docs/user-api.md#macro-bold-italic) and [ADP:WEB-LINK](/docs/user-api.md#macro-web-link). For example, if you try this:

```
(ADP:TEXT (ADP:BOLD (ADP:ITALIC "This should be bold-italic.")))
```

an error will be raised.

### Images

You can add images with the macro [ADP:IMAGE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-image). For example, an image is located at `guides/images/`. If I evaluate the next expression:

```
(ADP:IMAGE "Lisp logo" #P"guides/images/Lisp_logo.svg")
```

I get this:

![Lisp logo](/guides/images/Lisp_logo.svg)

The first argument is the alternative text of the image. If for some reason the image cannot be loaded in some web page, the alternative text is used instead. The second argument is the pathname of the image, relative to the system's root directory.

### Code blocks

A good Lisp tutorial must include Lisp code examples. ADP defines two macros to print code blocks: [ADP:CODE-BLOCK](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-block) and [ADP:CODE-EXAMPLE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-example). The main difference is that the former does not evaluate the code to be printed. So, for example:

```
(ADP:CODE-BLOCK NIL
  (THIS IS NOT (VALID CODE))
  (BUT IT (IS (OK))))
```

And you will see:

```
(THIS IS NOT (VALID CODE))

(BUT IT (IS (OK)))
```

Note that `NIL` is printed after `code-block`. This is because we can pass some symbols to [ADP:CODE-BLOCK](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-block) in order to change a bit how it works. But, we will see that in later sections.

On the other hand, [ADP:CODE-EXAMPLE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-example) do evaluate the code. And what is more, it prints the standard output as well as the returned values. For example:

```
(ADP:CODE-EXAMPLE
  (LOOP FOR I FROM 0 BELOW 10
        DO (PRINT I)
        FINALLY (RETURN (VALUES "Hello" "world"))))
```

And you will see:

```
(LOOP FOR I FROM 0 BELOW 10
      DO (PRINT I)
      FINALLY (RETURN (VALUES "Hello" "world")))

0 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
"Hello"
"world"
```

Both with [ADP:CODE-BLOCK](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-block) and with [ADP:CODE-EXAMPLE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-example) you can write multiple expressions.

## Generating the documentation

There are still some useful macros that I didn't explain yet. However, I think it is now a good time to learn how to actually generate the documentation. You may have multiple files where the macros expalined above are used. But, where the documentation will be printed in? Which files will be generated?

First, we need to understand how ADP works. When you load a project and a file contains calls to some of the above macros, ADP will store information from these macros (functions or symbols defined, tables, lists, text, etc). At every moment we can decide to associate the information gathered so far with a file using the macro [ADP:WRITE-IN-FILE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-write-in-file). A good way to use ADP is calling [ADP:WRITE-IN-FILE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-write-in-file) at the end of every file of code from your project. Doing that will create as many documentation files as code files your project has. Let's see an example. Imagine we have the following code in a file (it doesn't matter where it is located or even its name.)

```
(ADP:HEADER "My API")

(ADP:DEFUN FOO () "This function does a lot of things" ...)

(ADP:DEFUN BAR () "This function also does a lot of things")

(ADP:DEFPARAMETER *GLOBAL-PARAM* ... "This parameter is awesome")
```

Now, we want to create a file where to print this information in. In order to do that, we must use [ADP:WRITE-IN-FILE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-write-in-file).

```
(ADP:HEADER "My API")

(ADP:DEFUN FOO () "This function does a lot of things" ...)

(ADP:DEFUN BAR () "This function also does a lot of things")

(ADP:DEFPARAMETER *GLOBAL-PARAM* ... "This paramter is awesome")

(ADP:WRITE-IN-FILE #P"docs/my-api")
```

This macro receives only the pathname to the file where to print in the documentation. The pathname must be relative to the system's root directory. Also note that I didn't use any extension in the pathname. That's because ADP let you choose between different styles to generate the documentation and each style will create their own files. After using [ADP:WRITE-IN-FILE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-write-in-file), the header, the two functions and the parameter are associated with the file that will be located at `docs/my-api`. If the pathname was already used in another call to [ADP:WRITE-IN-FILE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-write-in-file), the new content will be appended to the information already gathered.

When all your documentation is associated with a file, it is time to generate the files and print the documentation. The function that must be used now is [ADP:LOAD-DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM](/docs/user-api.md#function-load-documentation-system). As the name suggests, you are going to load your system. In fact, it will load you system with the documentation generation enabled so, while forms are evaluated the documentation is gathered and also is associated with the pertinent files. When the system is completely loaded, the file generation and documentation printing begins. For example, if your system is named `MY-SYSTEM`, then you can eval this expression in the REPL:

```
(ADP:LOAD-DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM :MY-SYSTEM :GITHUB-MD)
```

The second argument is the desired style. In this case the used style is `GITHUB-MD`. This style generates `md` files to be used in the GitHub platform.

And that's all! The documentation is ready to be read.

## Cross references

ADP supports cross references with tags. A tag is a just a symbol with some information associated. There are five types of tags: header-tags, function-tags, symbol-tags, type-tags and code-tags.

### Header-tags

A header-tag is a symbol with a header associated. We have already seen how to add a header to the documentation. But I didn't say that the macros [ADP:HEADER](/docs/user-api.md#macro-header), [ADP:SUBHEADER](/docs/user-api.md#macro-subheader) and [ADP:SUBSUBHEADER](/docs/user-api.md#macro-subsubheader) receives a second optional argument. As you can imagine, this second argument must be a symbol that will be converted to a header tag. For example, the first header of this file is created with this expression:

```
(ADP:HEADER "The ADP User Guide" USER-GUIDE-HEADER)
```

Now the symbol `user-guide-header` is a header-tag. We can make a reference to that header with the macro [ADP:HEADER-REF](/docs/user-api.md#macro-header-ref). For example, if I write this:

```
(ADP:TEXT "Go to the top: " (ADP:HEADER-REF USER-GUIDE-HEADER))
```

Then you will see this:

Go to the top: [The ADP User Guide](/docs/user-guide.md#the-adp-user-guide)

Note that the macro is used inside a [ADP:TEXT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-text) form. Same as with [ADP:BOLD](/docs/user-api.md#macro-bold) or [ADP:ITALIC](/docs/user-api.md#macro-italic) [ADP:HEADER-REF](/docs/user-api.md#macro-header-ref) only can be used inside [ADP:TEXT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-text), [ADP:TABLE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-table) and [ADP:ITEMIZE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-itemize).

### Function-tags, symbol-tags and type-tags

These tags are symbols associated with a function, a variable or a type. More specifically, the macros used to define things like [ADP:DEFUN](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defun), [ADP:DEFPARAMETER](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defparameter) or [ADP:DEFSTRUCT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defstruct) can create automatically a function-tag, a symbol-tag or a type-tag respectively. The tag created is the symbol of the name of the function, variable or type defined respectively. ADP defines three types of tags because the same symbol can refer to a function, a variable and a type simultaneously. The next list shows what type of tags are defined by which macros:

* Function-tags:
  * [ADP:DEFGENERIC](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defgeneric)
  * [ADP:DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO](/docs/user-api.md#macro-define-modify-macro)
  * [ADP:DEFMACRO](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defmacro)
  * [ADP:DEFUN](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defun)
* Symbol-tags:
  * [ADP:DEFCONSTANT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defconstant)
  * [ADP:DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO](/docs/user-api.md#macro-define-symbol-macro)
  * [ADP:DEFPARAMETER](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defparameter)
  * [ADP:DEFVAR](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defvar)
* Type-tags:
  * [ADP:DEFCLASS](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defclass)
  * [ADP:DEFINE-CONDITION](/docs/user-api.md#macro-define-condition)
  * [ADP:DEFSTRUCT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-defstruct)
  * [ADP:DEFTYPE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-deftype)

Same as with header-tags, we can make reference to functions, variables and types with [ADP:FUNCTION-REF](/docs/user-api.md#macro-function-ref), [ADP:SYMBOL-REF](/docs/user-api.md#macro-symbol-ref) and [ADP:TYPE-REF](/docs/user-api.md#macro-type-ref). For example, to make a reference to an ADP macro:

```
(ADP:TEXT "A reference to an ADP macro: " (ADP:FUNCTION-REF ADP:HEADER))
```

You will see this:

A reference to an ADP macro: [ADP:HEADER](/docs/user-api.md#macro-header)

Note again that [ADP:FUNCTION-REF](/docs/user-api.md#macro-function-ref) only can be used inside [ADP:TEXT](/docs/user-api.md#macro-text), [ADP:TABLE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-table) or [ADP:ITEMIZE](/docs/user-api.md#macro-itemize). The same goes to [ADP:SYMBOL-REF](/docs/user-api.md#macro-symbol-ref) and [ADP:TYPE-REF](/docs/user-api.md#macro-type-ref).

A cool thing about cross references is that you can make a reference to something that is not currently defined but will be. For example, a variable will be defined at the end of this file but we can make a reference now. I'm writing the next expression:

```
(ADP:TEXT "In the future, we will define the symbol "
          (ADP:SYMBOL-REF A-PARAMETER-DEFINED-AT-THE-END-OF-THE-FILE) ".")
```

In the future, we will define the symbol [A-PARAMETER-DEFINED-AT-THE-END-OF-THE-FILE](/docs/user-guide.md#variable-a-parameter-defined-at-the-end-of-the-file).

Finally, an example using a type-tag:

```
(ADP:TEXT "Using a type tag: " (ADP:TYPE-REF ALSO-A-TYPE?))
```

Using a type tag: [ALSO-A-TYPE?](/docs/user-guide.md#condition-also-a-type)

### Code-tags

Code-tags work differently to those we have just seen above. Code-tags are used inside the [ADP:CODE-BLOCK](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-block) macro. Imagine that you are making a tutorial. You are explaining how some piece of code works and you test that code in a different file to make sure your tutorial is well done. But one day, you decide to change your code. Now the tutorial needs to be changed too. To avoid writing your code twice you can use code-tags. Suppose that your code looks like this:

```
(ADP:DEFUN SUM-LIST (INT-LIST)
  (LOOP FOR NUM IN INT-LIST
        SUM NUM))

(SUM-LIST '(1 2 3))
```

And you write in your tutorial that the function `sum-list` can be used the way you tested before:

```
(ADP:TEXT "The sum-list function can be used like this:")

(ADP:CODE-BLOCK NIL
  (SUM-LIST '(1 2 3)))
```

But now you decide to use vectors rather than lists. You didn't use code-tags so you must change your code in two different places. Let's create now a code-tag using the macro [ADP:CODE-TAG](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-tag). Unfortunately, the macro [ADP:CODE-TAG](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-tag) cannot be printed inside code-block. So, I will use `code-lag` instead:

```
(ADP:DEFUN SUM-LIST (INT-LIST)
  (LOOP FOR NUM IN INT-LIST
        SUM NUM))

(CODE-LAG (SUM-LIST-EXAMPLE) (SUM-LIST '(1 2 3)))
```

A code-tag named `sum-list-example` is created and you can now use it in the tutorial:

```
(ADP:TEXT "The sum-list function can be used like this:")

(ADP:CODE-BLOCK (SUM-LIST-EXAMPLE)
  SUM-LIST-EXAMPLE)
```

First we indicate in the list after `code-block` that we will use the code tag named `sum-list-example`. Then, we use it. Now, each time you change the call to `sum-list` in your test code the tutorial will be automatically changed. You can specify as many tags as you want in both [ADP:CODE-TAG](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-tag) and [ADP:CODE-BLOCK](/docs/user-api.md#macro-code-block) macros.

Let's see a live example. Do you remember the symbol [A-PARAMETER-DEFINED-AT-THE-END-OF-THE-FILE](/docs/user-guide.md#variable-a-parameter-defined-at-the-end-of-the-file) and the type [ALSO-A-TYPE?](/docs/user-guide.md#condition-also-a-type). In the source file I have written this:

```
(CODE-LAG (END-PARAMETER-CODE)
 (ADP:DEFPARAMETER A-PARAMETER-DEFINED-AT-THE-END-OF-THE-FILE T))

(CODE-LAG (END-TYPE-CODE) (ADP:DEFTYPE ALSO-A-TYPE? () NIL))
```

So, if right now I write this:

```
(ADP:CODE-BLOCK (END-PARAMETER-CODE END-TYPE-CODE)
  END-TYPE-CODE
  (SOME-CODE-IN (THE-MIDDLE))
  END-PARAMETER-CODE)
```

You will see this:

```
(ADP:DEFTYPE ALSO-A-TYPE? () NIL)

(SOME-CODE-IN (THE-MIDDLE))

(ADP:DEFPARAMETER A-PARAMETER-DEFINED-AT-THE-END-OF-THE-FILE T)
```

### Hiding your code

#### Variable: A-PARAMETER-DEFINED-AT-THE-END-OF-THE-FILE

```Lisp
(defparameter A-PARAMETER-DEFINED-AT-THE-END-OF-THE-FILE T)
```

#### Type: ALSO-A-TYPE?

```Lisp
(deftype ALSO-A-TYPE? NIL)
```
